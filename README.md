Instructions on how to run and modify the pipeline code files are available in Hamis et al. 2022 (Supplementary Information). 

The pipeline codes use the Unified Framework Software which was developed by Cornell et al. 2019. The Unified Framework Software codes must be downloaded and installed in order for all pipeline codes to work (see Cornell et al. 2019 for instructions).
